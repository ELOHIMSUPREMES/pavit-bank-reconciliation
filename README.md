# Pavit's Bank Reconciliation Project 

Automate the process of a CSV file from bank to the financial structural ontology. The process of matching the balances in an entity's accounting records for a cash account to the corresponding information on a bank statement. The goal of this process is to ascertain the differences between the two, and to book changes to the accounting records as appropriate.
